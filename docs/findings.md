## 8. Key Recommendations

### For Portfolio Management
1. **Industry Diversification:** Limit exposure to Retail Trade and Information sectors (16%+ default rates)
2. **Geographic Monitoring:** Enhanced oversight for Nevada, Florida, and Illinois exposures
3. **Vintage Tracking:** Implement enhanced monitoring for loans in years 2-3 of life when defaults peak
4. **Favor Healthcare/Agriculture:** These sectors show resilient 7% default rates across cycles

### For Risk Assessment
1. **Industry Risk Tiers:** Develop tiered pricing with 11+ percentage point spread between best/worst industries
2. **Economic Sensitivity:** 2007-2008 vintages show crisis can cause 3-5x normal default rates
3. **Geographic Risk Premiums:** Consider state-level risk factors (18% NV vs 7% MT)
4. **Seasoning Curves:** Most risk crystallizes in years 2-3; loans surviving 5+ years are low risk

### For Lender Management
1. **Performance Benchmarking:** Wide variation exists across 5,000+ lenders
2. **Industry Mix Monitoring:** Lender portfolios heavy in Retail/Information will underperform
3. **Geographic Diversification:** Single-state lenders in high-risk states face elevated losses

### For Policy/Research
1. **Crisis Preparedness:** 2007-2008 data provides stress test scenarios for future downturns
2. **COVID Monitoring:** 2020-2021 vintages performing well so far but still maturing
3. **Industry Targeting:** Healthcare and Agriculture show counter-cyclical stability

## 9. Data Quality Notes

### Completeness Assessment
| Field | Completeness | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Loan ID | 100% | Generated unique IDs |
| State | 100% | Full coverage |
| NAICS | 89.9% | 10.1% missing (older loans) |
| Loan Amount | 100% | Full coverage |
| Loan Status | 86.6% | 13.4% active/pending |
| Term | 99.9% | Excellent coverage |

### Overall Data Quality Score: 96.6%

### Known Limitations
1. **Active loans (13.4%):** Recently originated loans without final outcome
2. **NAICS gaps (10.1%):** Industry classification missing for some older vintages
3. **Jobs data:** Jobs supported field has inconsistent reporting pre-1998
4. **Recovery amounts:** Chargeoff amounts reported but recovery details limited

### Data Validation Findings
- **943 loans** with disbursement date before approval date (data entry issues)
- **8 loans** with invalid/zero amounts excluded from financial analysis
- **5 loans** with invalid state codes (territories not in reference table)

---

## 10. Methodology

### Data Source
- **SBA 7(a) FOIA Data** from data.sba.gov
- **1,912,539 records** spanning FY1991-FY2025
- **677 MB** of raw CSV data across 4 files
- Public domain, freely available, updated quarterly

### Analytical Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Standardized formats, handled 10% missing NAICS codes, validated dates
2. **Cohort Construction:** Grouped by vintage year for lifecycle analysis (35 cohorts)
3. **Risk Metrics:** Calculated PD (13.05%), LGD (62.5%), and expected loss by segment
4. **Statistical Validation:** Applied minimum 100-500 loan thresholds for reliability
5. **Segmentation:** Analyzed by state (62), industry (20 sectors), and lender (5,000+)

### Tools Used
- **PostgreSQL 15** for all SQL analysis
- **Window functions** for trend analysis, rolling calculations, rankings
- **CTEs** for complex multi-step calculations
- **Views** created for dashboard reporting (8 executive views)

### Key Assumptions
- Loans with NULL status treated as active/pending (excluded from default rate calculations)
- Default = CHGOFF status; Success = PIF status
- Loss Given Default calculated as chargeoff amount / gross approved amount
